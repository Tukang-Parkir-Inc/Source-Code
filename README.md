Hi! This is Tukang Parkir group from IF-46-INT.
We want to show you our source code for our Tukang Parkir Android App or you could call it a reservation parking app.
If you want to run this code, you need to:
1. Make a new Flutter project (recommend you to use VSCode).
2. Replace the lib folder with our lib folder.
3. Replace the pubspec.yaml with our pubspec.yaml.
4. Replace the cloud firebase / firebase core with your own firebase.
5. Replace the Android with our Android folder.

Thanks for visiting!!!
